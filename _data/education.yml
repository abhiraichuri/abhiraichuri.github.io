    During my Master's degree at Ohio University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
    we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I used a lot of these skills to
    my advantage in my day to day work.

    While at Ohio University I worked as a full stack developer on a state funding project and developed a web-based application
    for <mark> Cross District Transportation Scheduling(CD-TSA) </mark> for 20 school districs and one board of developmental disabilities(DD) in ohio.

    During my university time, I served on <mark> International Students Union(ISU) </mark> board and responsible for:
    - coordinating cultural activities & maintaing the website for ISU
    - providing oppurtunities for social and cultural exchange among foreign students and american students
    - assiting incoming international students in adopting to college life in foreign country
    - providing a support base and lobbying group for the concerns of international students.
